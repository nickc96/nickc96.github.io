		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I graduated from Villanova University in 2018 with a double major in Management Information Systems (MIS) and Computer Science and a minor in Business Analytics. I am currently working as a Cloud Customer Success Manager for Oracle. This basically means that I work with customers to understand their business and help ensure the success of their work in the cloud. It has been a great experience learning to work with so many different kinds of people in sales and technology and has really played to the strengths of both my majors. Despite this, I am looking to broaden my skills and to reinforce my coding skills in a future position.</p>
			<p>I have many interests and hobbies including...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Watching anime</li>
				<li>Playing video games</li>
				<li>Participating in tabletop roleplaying games (like DnD)</li>
				<li>Singing</li>
				<li>Reading</li>
				<li>Writing</li>
				<li>Creating video games</li>
				<li>Playing volleyball</li>
			</ul>
			<p>...and so on. Clearly I don't have enough time to do everything but it all comes in waves and I definitely prefer some things more than other.</p>
			<p>Since I'm currently living on my own, I've been trying more new activities that I have little to no experience in. I am using this blog partially to share my progress on these activities as a record. These skills are cooking and baking, arts (things like drawing), and crafts (things like sewing).</p>
